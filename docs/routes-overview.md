# Routes Overview

All routes are defined in `src/Routes.js` utilizing [React Router v5](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router).

All routes are located in `src/components/` and their corresponding child components in `/src/components/view[route name]`, with the exclusion of Home in which the children components are located in `src/components/home`.
